# Asynchronous Logic
A place for my asynchronous logic code. My initial goal is to build an asynchronous MIPS microprocessor. I'll be using Modelsim PE Student Edition for the simulation. I'm running windows, so I may use batch files.

I am using Null Convention Logic (see NCL.pdf for a paper that really helped me). The basic premise is to break data into `state present` and `state not present`. Only one state can be present at a time for a given signal, but it is possible to have no state (`Null`), indicating that the circuit hasn't finished yet. To be able to tell when the circuit is finished, the whole thing is cleared (`state not present` on all lines) between each operation (like a clock edge). The difference between this and a clock edge is that the circuit tells when it's done and signals the reset itself, running as fast as it can given current conditions (like temperature and such). The circuit is also garuanteed to always complete, where as a clock could run too fast and cause problems.
